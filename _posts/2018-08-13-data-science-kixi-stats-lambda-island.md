[kixi.stats](https://github.com/mastodonc/kixi.stats) is the subject of the latest Lambda Island screencast.

It's been my pleasure over the past couple of weeks to get to know [Arne Brasseur](https://twitter.com/plexus). He's the author of several Clojure libraries and also the [Lambda Island](https://lambdaisland.com/) screencasts. We shared several emails over the course of the production of the latest video: [Data Science with kixi.stats](https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/clojure-data-science-kixi-stats), part 1.

The screencast offers an excellent gentle introduction for those who want to understand how to use Clojure's transducers for explorative data analysis and is very clearly explained. A free trial is available if you're unsure whether to commit to a subscription, and 50% off the price is available to anyone who requires it. The code is freely available though, so you can [view the episode content on GitHub](https://github.com/lambdaisland/ep43-data-science-kixi-stats).

I'm really looking forward to part 2!
