### Usage

Once you have a running Minecraft server, connecting to it is simple.

```clojure
(require [redstone.client :as mc])

(def server
  {:host "localhost"
   :port 4711})

(mc/send-message! server "Hello Minecraft")
```

For lots more examples, including some project ideas, take a look at
the [Redstone readme](http://github.com/henrygarner/redstone).
