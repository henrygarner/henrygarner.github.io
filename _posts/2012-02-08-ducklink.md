[Ducklink](https://github.com/henrygarner/ducklink) is a [ruby gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/ducklink) I created to manipulate URLs according to a set of rules.

Rules are expressed in a custom DSL which aims to make the intention very clear.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/1772834.js"></script>

In the example above, a template is provided to a fictional affiliate provider, _affiliate.example.com_. The `template` function defines three custom variables, `reference`, `url` and `campaign`.

The only privileged parameter is `url`, which corresponds to the original url supplied to Ducklink. Other parameters are simply tokens which correspond to symbols passed to `set` inside the host blocks. Because host blocks list the hosts to which they apply, parameters can be defined on a per-host basis (the difference between 'campaign1' and 'campaign2' in the example above).

Host blocks accept a `context` argument which is a hash of values passed to Ducklink at runtime. Runtime configuration allows completely unique URLs to be generated on the fly for analytics or tracking.
