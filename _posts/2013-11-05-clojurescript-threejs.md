I gave a talk at the [London Clojurians](http://londonclojurians.org/)
Skills Matter meetup November 2013 on combining ClojureScript and
Three.js to create a [multiplayer game of Snake](https://github.com/henrygarner/multisnake) over WebSockets.

The
[video is here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4780-lcug-1st-lightening-talk#video)
and the
[slides are here](https://github.com/henrygarner/ldnclj-talk-nov-2013). If
you don't want to view the slides through the Reveal.js viewer I'm
using in the talk, you can just
[read the org document](https://github.com/henrygarner/ldnclj-talk-nov-2013/blob/master/talk.org)
they were generated from.
