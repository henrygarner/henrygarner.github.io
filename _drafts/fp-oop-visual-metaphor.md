Value of metaphor in understanding.

Repeated analogies expand concepts

Layely I've tried to explain the differences, as I see them, between
functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP) to
non-programmers. This is no easy task, relying as it does on being
able to communicate the 'shape', in abstract terms, of the program
being constructed.

Shapes in software are multi-dimensional, and any attempt to render
them in two (or even three) dimensions will neccessarily fall short.

However something about the work of two kinetic sculptors, both
practicing in the middle of the 20th Century, serves for me as a
visual metaphor of the two modes of problem solving.

Tinguely's Meta-mecanique (Meta-Herbin) _1954_, and Alexander Calder's
Blue Feather _1948_, were created only 6 years apart. Both were part
of a tradition of post-war Modernism.

Calder was the inventor of the mobile, and introduced movement to
sculpture. These contructions are called 'Kinetic' sculptures.

### OOP

Encapsulated state, action-control interfaces.

Classes, cogs, nouns, categories.

Inheritance.

### FP

Recursion.

Perhaps the most obvious metaphor, the concept of recursion. Clearly
visible in Blue Feather. This is not mere repetition. Each branch
depends on the previous branch for support and in turn provides
structure to those coming after.

Balance. Flat structure. Gravity is a force acting in one dimension.

Contrast with Tinguely's sculpture where, though the structure
supports itself, it contains internal structure and interfaces that
also convey force.

### Movement

[The Legacy of Alexander Calder](http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag98/calder/sm-caldr.shtml)

Managing state means managing _changing_ state.

This was difficult for sculptors.

> I [Jean Tinguely] met him with Daniel Spoerri and he told me that movement is nothing, it doesnâ€™t work, they had tried everything without success. That amused me very much because I felt that underneath they were longing for movement, like a whole generation of artists, and the only victorious one among them was Alexander Calder.
